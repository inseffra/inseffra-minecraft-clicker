## 🔒 Security Analysis

**Inseffra is 100% clean.** Some antivirus software flags autoclickers because they simulate mouse input - this is a false positive.

### Sandbox Analysis Reports

| Platform | Score | Link |
|----------|-------|------|
| Tria.ge | **6/10** (Normal for autoclickers) | [View Report](https://tria.ge/260102-zsgvhssmfs/behavioral1) |
| Hybrid Analysis | Full behavior analysis | [View Report](https://hybrid-analysis.com/sample/3908b6950ddd8845c46c4c9c56696ce65773943819c602cd203ab209c713a471) |

### Why some AV flag this? (Detailed Explanation)

| Detection | Real Reason |
|-----------|-------------|
| "Keyboard/Mouse simulation" | **Core autoclicker feature.** Uses `SendInput` and `mouse_event` Windows APIs to simulate clicks. This is literally what an autoclicker does. |
| "Keylogger/Keyboard strokes" | **Hotkey detection.** Uses `GetAsyncKeyState` to detect when you press your configured hotkeys (e.g., Mouse4 to toggle clicker). Does NOT record or save any keystrokes. |
| "Clipboard access" | **AutoText feature.** When you press your AutoText hotkey, the program copies your message to clipboard and pastes it in-game using Ctrl+V. This is faster and more reliable than simulating individual keypresses. |
| "Screenshot API" | **Stream Proof feature.** Uses `SetWindowDisplayAffinity` to make the window invisible to screen capture. Needs to query display information to work properly. Does NOT take screenshots. |
| "Network connection" | **Update checker** connects to `raw.githubusercontent.com` to check for new versions. **Anonymous analytics** sends session count to Supabase (no personal data). |
| "Unknown user-agent" | **Custom user-agent.** Update checker uses `Inseffra Updater` as user-agent string instead of a browser name. |
| "Anti-debug/VM detection" | **Tamper protection.** Prevents analysis tools from modifying program behavior. Standard protection used by many legitimate applications. |
| "Terminate process" | **Self-destruct feature.** Allows user to quickly close the program with a hotkey. Only terminates its own process. |
| "Sleeps many times" | **CPS timing.** Program uses `Sleep()` to create delays between clicks. 15 CPS = ~66ms sleep between each click. |
| "Queries IE/cache settings" | **WinINet API side effect.** Using Windows internet APIs for update checking triggers this detection. Does NOT access your browser data. |
| "Unsigned PE" | **No code signing certificate.** Certificates cost $200-400/year. This doesn't mean the program is malicious. |

### What Inseffra actually does:

✅ **Network:** Connects only to `raw.githubusercontent.com` (updates) and `supabase.co` (anonymous session analytics)  
✅ **Files:** Writes only to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Inseffra\` (settings file: `options.json`)  
✅ **Privacy:** No personal data collected - only anonymous session count  
✅ **Processes:** No hidden processes, no injection into other programs  
✅ **Registry:** No registry modifications  
✅ **Startup:** Does not add itself to Windows startup
