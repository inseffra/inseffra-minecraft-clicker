## Security Analysis

Inseffra uses standard Windows APIs for input simulation and is frequently flagged by heuristic antivirus engines. All detections are false positives.

### Independent Sandbox Analysis

| Platform | Result | Report |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Tria.ge | 6/10 - Likely Benign | [View Report](https://tria.ge/260102-zsgvhssmfs/behavioral1) |
| Hybrid Analysis | Full Behavioral Analysis | [View Report](https://hybrid-analysis.com/sample/3908b6950ddd8845c46c4c9c56696ce65773943819c602cd203ab209c713a471) |

### Detection Explanations

| Detection | Reason |
|-----------|--------|
| Keyboard/Mouse simulation | Uses `SendInput` and `mouse_event` Windows APIs - core autoclicker functionality |
| Hotkey detection | Uses `GetAsyncKeyState` to detect configured hotkeys - does not log keystrokes |
| Clipboard access | AutoText feature uses clipboard for faster message sending |
| Screen capture API | Stream Proof uses `SetWindowDisplayAffinity` to hide from capture software |
| Network connection | Update checker connects to `raw.githubusercontent.com` and anonymous analytics to `supabase.co` |
| Sleep calls | CPS timing requires precise delays between clicks |
| Unsigned binary | Code signing certificates cost $200-400/year - absence does not indicate malware |

### Actual Behavior

**Network:** GitHub (updates), Supabase (anonymous analytics)  
**File System:** `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Inseffra\options.json` only  
**Privacy:** No personal data collection  
**Processes:** Single-process application, no injection  
**Registry:** No modifications  
**Startup:** Does not auto-start with Windows
